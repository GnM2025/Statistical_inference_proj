# Statistical_inference_final

All notebooks used are in the notebooks folder:

1.IL_data.ipynb - Most of the israeli data processed and tested.

2.NY_data.ipynb - Smaller, Test for NewYork data and some cross data tests.

3.kaggle_data.ipynb - Tests for the data of prices out of kaggle, Isnt mentioned in the article, this was the first research that led me towards an exhausting search for real data.

4.IL_extra.ipynb - just distributions and some figures. 

1 and 2 should run just fine in the repo. 

3 and 4 are not so interesting, but will run as well.


The Data : 

data/raw -> 'IL' or 'kaggle' or 'NY' :
1. IL - 6 files , get auto combined when running.
2. NY - 3 files , same.
3. kaggle - 1 file processed in the notebook.
